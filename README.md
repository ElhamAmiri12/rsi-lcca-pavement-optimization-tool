# RSI-LCCA Pavement Network Tool

This repository contains the code for an RSI- and LCCA-based pavement network optimization framework.
It includes:
- Remaining Service Interval (RSI) performance modeling for flexible pavements.
- Life-Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) at project and network level.
- Enumeration of all feasible maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (MR&R) treatments.
- Optimization of MR&R alternatives under budget constraint.
